Introduction
============

About
-----

CFDwavemaker is a C++ library developed with the soule purpose of providing wave kinematics data for

* initializing a CFD domain with millions of cells in a fast and efficient manner
* work as a wave maker, prescribing kinematics at the boundaries of the CFD domain during runtime
