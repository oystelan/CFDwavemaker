Todo-list
=========

Here is a list of planned upgrades,ideas and improvements to the library:

- Update manual (ongoing)
- Implement sloping bottom (variable water depth)
- upgrade second order velocity profile model to a consistent second order wheeler type stretching , Ref. :cite:`smit2017nonlinear`
- Implement Higher order spectral method connection through the swd library `spectral_wave_data`_ (work started)
- Implement grid interpolation scheme for boundaries (ongoing)
- update grid interpolation structure to vertical lagrangian type, which follows the wave surface, to make more efficient and accurate.
- Add commonly used wave spectra and directional spreading functions for easy generation without specifying manually frequency amplitudes, phase etc. (work started)
- preprogrammed constrained new wave. kind of a nice to have.
