CFDwavemaker's documentation
============================

CFDwavemaker is a C++ library developed with the purpose of providing wave kinematics input to CFD codes.
More specifically, CFDwavemaker is capable of generating irregular short crested waves with several hundreds of frequency components using second order potential wave theory in a numerically efficient way. Kinematics may either be generated at the boundary (similar to a traditional wave maker) or used to initialize the entire domain before startup of the simulation (in which case it would be wise to use periodic domains).
A example snapshot of a simulation is shown below, where CFDwavemaker has been used to inialize a CFD simulation run with open source code `Basilisk`_.
