.. warning::
   Warnings are formatted in the same way as notes. In the same way, lines
   must be broken and indented under the warning tag.

.. note::
   This is note text. If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap
   and are indented to the same level as the note tag. If formatting is
   incorrect, part of the note might not render in the HTML output.

   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent
   to the same level as the rest of the note.

   print("A literal block directive explicitly marked as python code")


.. code:: C++

   fprintf(stderr,"A literal block directive explicitly marked as python code\n");
