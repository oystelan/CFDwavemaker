Introduction
============

About
-----

CFDwavemaker is a C++ library developed with the soule purpose of providing wave kinematics data for

* initializing a CFD domain with millions of cells in a fast and efficient manner
* work as a wave maker, prescribing kinematics at the boundaries of the CFD domain during runtime

The specific focus of this code is on higher order irregular wave theories for deep and intermediate water depths. A few showcases illustrating what can be achieved using this code in combination with some state of the art CFD codes are shown below.


Showcases
---------

Wave Flume

*to be completed soon*
