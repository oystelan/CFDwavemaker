Compiling CFDwavemaker from source can be a bit tricky. Therefore prebuilt version of the CFDwavemaker can be downloaded following the links below. Unpack the files and follow the installation instructions in :numref:`installation:Installation and usage`.

Linux/UNIX
----------

`CFDwavemaker v2.1.4 for Linux`_ ( compiled using ubuntu (v1604) with openMP support)

Windows

.. note::

    In version 2.1.3 spectral-wave-data library was implemented into CFDwavemaker, which is based on FORTRAN and requires intel fortran compiler to build in windows. The windows version is therefore temporarily not available, but will be once linking issues during compilation is resolved.
